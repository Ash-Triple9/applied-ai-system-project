================
Backend logic for PawPal+ — a pet care scheduling assistant.

Class hierarchy
---------------
Task
    A single care activity assigned to a pet.

Pet
    A pet owned by an Owner. Holds a list of Tasks.

Owner
    The person using the app. Owns one or more Pets and sets
    the total time available for care each day.

Scheduler
    The scheduling engine. Retrieves pending tasks from an Owner's
    pets, sorts them by priority, and greedily fits as many as
    possible within the owner's available time budget.

Scheduling algorithm
--------------------
Tasks are sorted by:
  1. Priority  — high (0) → medium (1) → low (2)
  2. Duration  — shorter tasks first within the same priority tier
                 (maximises the number of tasks completed)

Frequency filtering
-------------------
``get_pending_tasks()`` respects the ``Task.frequency`` field:
  - ``"daily"``, ``"as_needed"``, and ``"one_time_only"`` tasks are always eligible.
  - ``"weekly"`` tasks are eligible only when never completed or
    last completed ≥ 7 days ago (tracked via ``Task.last_done_date``).

Time slots
----------
``build_schedule()`` assigns a ``scheduled_start`` (minutes from
midnight) to each scheduled task, starting from
``Scheduler.day_start_minutes`` (default 480 = 8:00 AM).

Conflict detection
------------------
After building the schedule the scheduler checks for priority
inversions — cases where a higher-priority task was skipped while
lower-priority tasks were scheduled. Detected conflicts are stored
in ``Scheduler.conflicts`` and included in ``explain_plan()``.

Tasks that do not fit within the remaining time budget are collected
in ``skipped_tasks`` and reported via ``explain_plan()``.

    Represents a single pet care activity.

    Attributes
    ----------
    title : str
        Short name for the task (e.g. "Morning walk").
    duration_minutes : int
        How long the task takes in minutes.
    priority : str
        Scheduling urgency — one of ``"high"``, ``"medium"``, or ``"low"``.
    frequency : str
        How often the task recurs — ``"daily"`` (default), ``"weekly"``,
        ``"as_needed"``, or ``"one_time_only"``.
    completed : bool
        ``True`` once the task has been marked done for the day.
    pet_name : str or None
        Name of the pet this task belongs to. Set automatically by
        ``Pet.add_task()``.
    last_done_date : str or None
        ISO date (``"YYYY-MM-DD"``) of the most recent ``mark_complete()``
        call. Used by ``is_due_today()`` to gate weekly tasks.
    scheduled_start : int or None
        Minutes from midnight assigned by ``Scheduler.build_schedule()``.
        ``None`` when not yet scheduled.
    preferred_time : str or None
        Owner's preferred wall-clock start time in ``"HH:MM"`` 24-hour
        format (e.g. ``"08:00"``, ``"17:30"``). Used by
        ``Scheduler.sort_by_time()`` to order tasks chronologically.
        ``None`` means no preference; such tasks sort to the end.
    non_negotiable : bool
        When ``True``, this task must be included in the schedule.
        ``Scheduler.build_schedule()`` always places non-negotiable tasks
        first, even if their total duration exceeds the owner's time budget.
    next_due_date : str or None
        ISO date (``"YYYY-MM-DD"``) on or after which this task becomes
        eligible again. Set automatically by ``Pet.complete_and_reschedule()``
        on the freshly created next-occurrence instance:

        - ``"daily"``  → today + 1 day  (via ``timedelta(days=1)``)
        - ``"weekly"`` → today + 7 days (via ``timedelta(days=7)``)
        - ``"as_needed"`` / ``"one_time_only"`` → not set; no next occurrence
          is created

        When ``None``, ``is_due_today()`` falls back to frequency logic.
